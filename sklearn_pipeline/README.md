I created this folder to pratice my skills with Sklearn's pipeline modules so that I can use it efficiently in daily works.

There are 3 steps for praticing this:

1. Familiarize myself with the package and draw up areas to explore

- Find a tutorial, follow through
- Write down my questions about the concept and the package
- Write down my ideas for what to implement in this package

2. Find the answers for the questions

3. Refine and implement the ideas for the package
